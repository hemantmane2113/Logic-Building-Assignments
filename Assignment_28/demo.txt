When the operands of an equality operator are of the array type, it always evaluates to false.
Reason: In C language, the name of an array refers to the address of the first element of the
array and the addresses of first elements of two arrays can never be the same. Hence, when
the operands of an equality operator are of array type, it always evaluates to false. Program
4-6 illustrates the mentioned fact.
